My teaching is grounded in inquiry-based, student-centered learning that prompts students to engage in mathematical thinking, collaborate with peers, and make sense of ideas collectively.</p> <h3 id="mag-class-design"> <img class="emoji" title=":mag:" alt=":mag:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f50d.png" height="20" width="20"> Class Design</h3> <p>I have several years of experience facilitating active-learning lectures using strategies like Think-Pair-Share in linear algebra and first-year calculus courses. I am particularly interested in inquiry-based and inverted classroom models, where lectures become spaces for exploration and the instructor acts as a facilitator on the side.</p> <h3 id="balance_scale-assessment"> <img class="emoji" title=":balance_scale:" alt=":balance_scale:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2696.png" height="20" width="20"> Assessment</h3> <p>My teaching is informed by a belief that mathematical thinking is not reserved for the “gifted” and that growth mindset and effort matter more than innate ability. I aim to design assessments, such as reflection assignments and collaborative projects, that support diverse learners and value multiple ways of engaging with mathematics. Assessment data should serve as feedback, offering instructors a window into students’ thinking and providing students with insights into their own learning processes.</p> <h3 id="seedling-broader-goal"> <img class="emoji" title=":seedling:" alt=":seedling:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f331.png" height="20" width="20"> Broader Goal</h3> <p>Ultimately, I want students to build a relationship with mathematics that is empowering and meaningful, regardless of whether they pursue it professionally as mathematicians. I want to support students in following their aspirations, and mathematics is one of many tools they might find useful along the way.</p> <p>University is a space for exploration, but institutional constraints like large class sizes and rigid program structures can limit how much one can support each individual student. Even so, I find deep joy in teaching: in witnessing the moments when a small classroom activity or a rich peer discussion sparks a student’s interest in mathematics. These moments mirror how I first fell in love with the subject, and they continue to inspire my commitment to teaching.</p> <hr> <h3 id="-teaching-experience">👩🏻‍🏫 Teaching Experience</h3> <p><strong>Integral Calculus with Applications</strong><br> <em>Winter 2023</em>, MATH 101, UBC<br> Small Class Instructor</p> <hr> <p><strong>First-Year Focus Seminar in the Computational Sciences</strong><br> <em>Summer 2022 &amp; Fall 2022</em>, SCIE 100, UBC<br> Graduate Curriculum Assistant and Teaching Assistant</p> <hr> <p><strong>Numerical Methods for Differential Equations</strong><br> <em>Fall 2022</em>, MATH 405, UBC<br> Graduate Teaching Assistant</p> <hr> <p><strong>Mathematical Research and Writing</strong><br> <em>Winter 2022</em>, MATH 444, UBC<br> Graduate Teaching Assistant</p> <hr> <p><strong>Integral Calculus with Applications to Commerce and Social Sciences</strong><br> <em>Winter 2022</em>, MATH 105, UBC<br> Graduate Teaching Assistant</p> <hr> <p><strong>Calculus III</strong><br> <em>Fall 2021</em>, MATH 200, UBC<br> Graduate Teaching Assistant</p> <hr> <p><strong>Linear Algebra I</strong><br> <em>Fall 2018, Winter 2019, Fall 2019, Winter 2020, Fall 2020, Winter 2021</em>, MAT223, UofT<br> Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</p> <hr> <h3 id="memo-student-evaluations--math-101-winter-2023"> <img class="emoji" title=":memo:" alt=":memo:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png" height="20" width="20"> Student Evaluations – MATH 101 (Winter 2023)</h3> <p>Each quote below comes from the open-ended section of anonymous course evaluation in response to the prompt: <em>“Please comment on what your instructor did well to support your learning.”</em></p> <h4 id="large_blue_diamond-a15-session"> <img class="emoji" title=":large_blue_diamond:" alt=":large_blue_diamond:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f537.png" height="20" width="20"> A15 Session</h4> <ul> <li>“Changed structure as course progressed to better fit student needs.”</li> <li>“Overall great person.
