My teaching is grounded in inquiry-based, student-centered learning that prompts students to engage in mathematical thinking, collaborate with peers, and make sense of ideas collectively.</p> <h3 id="mag-class-design"> <img class="emoji" title=":mag:" alt=":mag:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f50d.png" height="20" width="20"> Class Design</h3> <p>I have several years of experience facilitating active-learning lectures using strategies like Think-Pair-Share in linear algebra and first-year calculus courses. I am particularly interested in inquiry-based and inverted classroom models, where lectures become spaces for exploration and the instructor acts as a facilitator on the side.</p> <h3 id="balance_scale-assessment"> <img class="emoji" title=":balance_scale:" alt=":balance_scale:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2696.png" height="20" width="20"> Assessment</h3> <p>My teaching is informed by a belief that mathematical thinking is not reserved for the “gifted” and that growth mindset and effort matter more than innate ability. I aim to design assessments, such as reflection assignments and collaborative projects, that support diverse learners and value multiple ways of engaging with mathematics. Assessment data should serve as feedback, offering instructors a window into students’ thinking and providing students with insights into their own learning processes.</p> <h3 id="seedling-broader-goal"> <img class="emoji" title=":seedling:" alt=":seedling:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f331.png" height="20" width="20"> Broader Goal</h3> <p>Ultimately, I want students to build a relationship with mathematics that is empowering and meaningful, regardless of whether they pursue it professionally as mathematicians. I want to support students in following their aspirations, and mathematics is one of many tools they might find useful along the way.</p> <p>University is a space for exploration, but institutional constraints like large class sizes and rigid program structures can limit how much one can support each individual student. Even so, I find deep joy in teaching: in witnessing the moments when a small classroom activity or a rich peer discussion sparks a student’s interest in mathematics. These moments mirror how I first fell in love with the subject, and they continue to inspire my commitment to teaching.</p> <hr> <h2 id="hammer_and_wrench-ta-training--professional-development"> <img class="emoji" title=":hammer_and_wrench:" alt=":hammer_and_wrench:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f6e0.png" height="20" width="20"> TA Training &amp; Professional Development</h2> <p>My involvement in supporting TA training began as an observation TA at the University of Toronto, where I provided formative feedback to new TAs by observing their discussion sections and helping them develop reflective teaching practices aligned with their goals.</p> <p>At UBC, I continued this commitment by facilitating informal teaching lunches in the Mathematics Department, and by helping lead training workshops for new TAs of SCIE courses in the Faculty of Science.</p> <p>To further develop my pedagogical skills, I completed a Mathematics Teaching Techniques course at the Mathematics Department, where I received personalized feedback on lesson planning and delivered a guest lecture, in preparation to teach undergraduate mathematics. I also participated in the Mathematics Instructional Skills Workshop (ISW) and the CIRTL Summer Teaching Institute’s Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Workshop, earning a <a href="https://cirtl.ubc.ca/get-involved/cirtl-associate/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">CIRTL Associate</a> certificate.</p> <p>As part of a reflection activity in the ISW workshop, two fellow participants composed the following creative slant poem, in response to my mini-lesson teaching, a piece I found both touching and heartwarming:</p> <blockquote style="font-size: 0.95em;"> <p><strong>The Feedback Poem</strong><br> <em>By Caleb and Jack</em></p> <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Nancy, a teacher of math
Nancy, if she were a graph, then
Nancy, would be monotone increasing because
Nancy, keeps her learners achieving.

She’s organized and sweet, has origami art
And always makes sure her learners are a part of cycle of Kolb, and I don’t mean Colby like the cheese

Because Nancy is a teacher who will help you achieve your mathematical dreams

Her learners come first, and her care is key
Just like a fractal, her growth will be
Going on and on from day 1 to infinity

Nancy, peach out *mic drop*</pre> </blockquote> <h2 id="art-designing-a-first-year-cohort-based-program"> <img class="emoji" title=":art:" alt=":art:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f3a8.png" height="20" width="20"> Designing a First-Year Cohort-Based Program</h2> <p>In parallel, I contributed to curriculum development for the <a href="https://fyf.science.ubc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">First Year Focus</a> program in the summer of 2022. As a graduate curriculum assistant, I helped design a cohort-based seminar course supporting first-year students’ transition to university. The course emphasized metacognitive skills, a sense of belonging, and exploration of disciplinary identity. In the following semester, I served as the graduate teaching assistant for the course. I led a team of six undergraduate TAs in facilitating tutorials and provided ongoing professional development.
