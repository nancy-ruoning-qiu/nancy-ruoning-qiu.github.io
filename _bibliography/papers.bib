  abstract = {Producing open-ended creative work through crowdsourcing remains a challenge, as workers often lack domain expertise, and requesters struggle to provide scalable guidance. Can the workers themselves create materials that guide subsequent workers? In this paper, we prototype a workflow for emergent scaffolding, where hints, rubrics, and examples are generated by crowd workers after attempting the task. We demonstrate how an iterative Train-Try-Reflect-Synthesize pattern—supported by LLMs—can produce a structured rubric with graded examples to guide subsequent workers on a task to create digital illustrations for scientific papers. To evaluate this strategy, we conducted a between-subjects experiment with three conditions: baseline instructions, generic examples, and emergent scaffolding. Participants in the emergent scaffolding condition created significantly better illustrations, as rated by blind-to-condition judges, compared to generic examples or instructions only. While self-efficacy ratings were mixed across conditions, emergent scaffolding participants provided better feedback during their post-task reflections. We discuss the potential for emergent scaffolding to support and scale up complex, creative tasks in crowdwork.},

  abstract = {Many studies showed that students find it challenging to develop a proper understanding of the rigorous $\epsilon$-N definition of a convergent sequence in relation to the concept of limit, a crucial building block to help students make sense of formalized mathematical statements. In the study, I interviewed two students with the $\epsilon$-strip activity to examine how they reasoned about sequence convergence and analyzed the interview data to inspect whether  $\epsilon$-strip plays the role of defining in student progress from informal to more formal ways of reasoning as a mathematical activity, in other words, to theorize the $\epsilon$-strip activity with the defining as a mathematical activity (DMA) framework that expands realistic mathematics education (RME). The results reconfirmed the effectiveness of how $\epsilon$-strip activity scaffolds the rigorous $\epsilon$-N definition and supported the practicability of DMA and RME to guide instructional task design.},

  abstract = {In this study, we analyze interviews with prospective secondary school teachers focused on how an upper division inquiry-oriented content course influenced their beliefs about learning and teaching mathematics. In particular, we examine how students describe their experiences in this course and the extent to which (and why) students see themselves using an inquiry-oriented instructional approach in their future teaching. Using thematic analysis, we found that the ways prospective teachers described their experiences in the course aligned closely with the four pillars of Inquiry-Based Mathematics Education, and the course empowered students to embrace a critical stance to self-reflect on their experiences and to raise their awareness of their agency to change things (for the better) through their own actions and future forms of instruction.},
